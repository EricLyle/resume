======

This is my resume compiled in latex using moderncv theme.

LaTeX is a high-quality typesetting system. You can get TeX Live in "http://www.tug.org/texlive/" for Linux.

The moderncv theme is contributed by Xavier Danaux.

You can download the source code in "http://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/moderncv/"
